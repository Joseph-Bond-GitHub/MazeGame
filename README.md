# MazeGame
A maze game. Through the creation of this game wenwill be able to explore how to implement a GUI using javaFX. We will also look at the necessary algorithms for generating the maze and for ensuring it is solvable. 

# Rough Plan:
1. Create a first version of the home page with javaFX
2. Create a game window accessed by pressing start on the home page
3. Add a small grid of tiles to the game window (10x10 max)
4. Add code to generate a variable sized grid based on a width and height variable (where width = height). And add multiple options on the home page for different grid sizes
5. Add logic to generate a variable sized grid where height != width

# Later features
1. Decide on what data we want to store about users
2. Decide on a database structure to store user data
3. Decide on how we will collect this data
4. Implement data collection (sign up screen and collecting data from games (e.g. games played, time to complete a maze))
5. Create a system admin login? (An account that can access a screen that shows them all of the currently logged in users)
